My geography Y1 notes 

Atmosphere:   Air surrounding the earth is known as the atmosphere. Change in weather elements such as temperature, winds, rainfall and humidity occur in the layer of atmosphere closest to the earth's surface. Geographers investigate the processes in the atmosphere.

Biosphere: This refers to all life on earth including animals and plants. The biosphere provides food and the plants absorb carbon dioxide and releases oxygen into the atmosphere. Geographers study the features of the biosphere (eg. Rainforests next chapter) We also study human interaction with the biosphere. 

Hydrosphere: This refers to all water on earth, including oceans, rivers, lakes, wetlands, ice sheets, underground water and moisture in the air. Water covers about 70% of the earthâ€™s surface. Water moves in its different states, through the biosphere, lithosphere and atmosphere. We study how the processes in the hydrosphere and how it affects human life (eg. water shortage unit 2)  

Lithosphere: It is the outermost solid part of the earth; rocks that make up mountains, hills and plains. Earthquakes occur where the lithosphere moves. We study the features of the lithosphere to know how landforms come about and how it interrelates with the human environment. (eg. humans drill deep into the earth to obtain energy resources like coal.)
